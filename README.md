# Mini-NASM-project
This project is something used to learn the basics of the NASM assembly language

Basically what it does is it displays arrays of size 1-8 as boxes, and you can swap their positions in the array 
by entering what boxes you want to swap. The concept is really easy to do in a higher level language but was slightly
tricky doing it in a lower-level language.
